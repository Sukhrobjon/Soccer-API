# Soccer API


## What it is
The Soccer API is a RESTful API that stores all available leagues. By creating an account, you will be able to submit character data. I am currently working on adding characters and planets to the database and have added the option for you to contribute as well. I am still working on how to verify the input from users. Check out the live deployment [here]https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/football-api-sg).
